	abstract = {Acoustic data can be a source of important information about events and the environment in modern cities. To date, much of the focus has been on monitoring noise pollution, but the urban soundscape contains a rich variety of signals about both human and natural phenomena. We describe the CitySounds project, which has installed enclosed sensor kits at several locations across a heavily used urban greenspace in the city of Edinburgh. The acoustic monitoring components regularly capture short clips in real-time of both ultrasonic and audible noises, for example encompassing bats, birds and other wildlife, traffic, and human. The sounds are complemented by collecting other data from sensors, such as temperature and relative humidity. To ensure privacy and compliance with relevant legislation, robust methods render completely unintelligible any traces of voice or conversation that may incidentally be overheard by the sensors. We have adopted a variety of methods to encourage community engagement with the audio data and to communicate the richness of urban soundscapes to a general audience.},

The addition of unification to these two frameworks allows a simple account of interaction between different linguistic levels within a constraining, monostraial theory. The resulting, computationally efficient, system provides an explicit formal framework for linguistic description, within which large fragments of grammars for French and English have already been developed. We present the formal basis of UCG, with independent definitions of well-formedness for syntactic and semantic dimensions. We will also focus on the concept of modifier within the theory.},

The e-Science vision, and the creation of the e-Science Grid, promises the level of integrated large- scale technological support required to sustain this important and successful new technology area. In this paper, we discuss the foundations for the deployment of text mining and other language technology on the Grid — the protocols and tools required to build distributed large-scale language technology systems, meeting the needs of users, application builders and researchers.},

	abstract = {We describe the Edinburgh-Stanford approach to task 2 of the Pascal Challenge Evaluating Machine Learning for Information Extraction, the active learning task. Active learning promises to reduce the cost of supervised training by requesting the most informative data points for human annotation. The literature contains a number of approaches to selecting informative data points. Example informativity can be estimated by the degree of uncertainty of a single learner as to the correct label of a data point (Cohn et al., 1995) or in terms of the disagreement of a committee of learners (Seung et al., 1992). Active learning has been successfully applied to a variety of tasks such as document classification (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), part-of-speech tagging (Argamon-Engelson and Dagan, 1999), and parsing (Thompson et al., 1999). We employ a committee-based method where the degree of deviation of different classifiers with respect to their analysis can tell us if an example is potentially useful. Trained classifiers can be caused to be different by bagging (Abe and Mamitsuka, 1998), by randomly perturbing event counts (Argamon-Engelson and Dagan, 1999), or by employing different feature sets for the same classifiers (Baldridge and Osborne, 2004). In this paper, we present active learning experiments for information extraction following the last approach. Our approach gives the highest average improvement over random sampling for micro-averaged and macro-averaged f-scores.},

Information states are identified with sets of possible worlds—the epistemic possibilities which those states admit. Generic rules, like On weekdays, Giles normally gets up at 8.00 are then taken to induce a pre-order on possible worlds, where worlds complying with the rules are less exceptional than those which go against the rules. Thus, a particular weekday on which Giles gets up at 8.00 is less exceptional than one on which he stays in bed till noon. Unlike many other approaches to nonmonotonicity, we draw a distinction at the level of the object language between defeasible and indefeasible conclusions.},

The project aimed to assist environmental historians in understanding the economic and environmental consequences of commodity trading during the 19th century. We applied TM to large quantities of historical text, converting unstructured textual information into structured data. The structured data was used to populate a relational database that is in turn the back end for querying and different types of online visualisations. We will discuss some of the challenges involved when processing digitised historical text which originally appeared in printed form.},

We report on three experiments measuring the extent to which curation can be speeded up with assistance from Natural Language Processing (NLP), together with subjective feedback from curators on the usability of a curation tool that integrates NLP hypotheses for protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In our curation scenario, we found that a maximum speed-up of 1/3 in curation time can be expected if NLP output is perfectly accurate. The preference of one curator for consistent NLP output and output with high recall needs to be confirmed in a larger study with several curators.},

	abstract = {Background:
The tasks in BioCreative II were designed to approximate some of the laborious work involved in curating biomedical research papers. The approach to these tasks taken by the University of Edinburgh team was to adapt and extend the existing natural language processing (NLP) system that we have developed as part of a commercial curation assistant. Although this paper concentrates on using NLP to assist with curation, the system can be equally employed to extract types of information from the literature that is immediately relevant to biologists in general.

Results:
Our system was among the highest performing on the interaction subtasks, and competitive performance on the gene mention task was achieved with minimal development effort. For the gene normalization task, a string matching technique that can be quickly applied to new domains was shown to perform close to average.

Conclusion:
The technologies being developed were shown to be readily adapted to the BioCreative II tasks. Although high performance may be obtained on individual tasks such as gene mention recognition and normalization, and document classification, tasks in which a number of components must be combined, such as detection and normalization of interacting protein pairs, are still challenging for NLP systems.},

This framework also helps users to create and share so-called micro-themes, which is applicable to the above generated content for the purpose of page styling and also highly reusable thanks to the adopted semantic attribute selectors.},

These solutions are either derived from traditional Web service standards such as WSDL or inspired by the theory of process calculus. Little attention has however been paid to finding a lightweight solution which can enable peers to obtain, publish and share service choreography in an open environment or peer-to-peer network. This paper proposes a framework for choreographing semantically enhanced Web Services encoded in a extended lightweight coordinative language which is derived from process calculus and is dedicated to running in modern Web browsers. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented and demoed as a decentralised service choreography-management platform based on this framework. There is no need for users to install any third-party application, and service choreography execution is achieved via client-side Web browsers. Also, the preliminary experiments indicate the efficiency and scalability of our proof-of-concept implementation of this framework.},

RDFa2 is a proof-of-concept implementation for our approach and works as an online platform assisting Web content publishers in semi-automatically generating, personalising and curating pages with RDFa. RDFa2 has been introduced and employed by students in a master level course and the experimental results as well as additional case studies indicate the validity of this approach to generating triple-embedded Web documents such as online profiles and vocabularies with little user intervention.},

	abstract = {One of the major innovations within post-SPE generative phonology has been the development of frameworks where phonological units are organized in a non-linear fashion. Taking autosegmental phonology (Goldsmith, 1976) as our main exemplar of such frameworks, we wish to address the following question: What is the appropriate interpretation of autosegmental representations? There is, of course, a further question about what we mean by INTERPRETATION: formal, phonetic or computational interpretation? Although we will concentrate on the first of these, we believe that all three aspects should be regarded as closely inter-connected and mutually constraining. The question of interpreting autosegmental representation has in fact been recently posed by Sagey (1988), and we shall take her proposal as our starting point. While it is uncontroversial to suppose that the relationship between units on a given autosegmental tier is one of temporal precedence, Sagey claims that it is more problematic to pin down what is meant by association between tiers. She argues, cogently we believe, that if association is taken to be a relationship of simultaneity between durationless units, then standard analyses of complex segments and gemination lead to logical inconsistency. Instead, association should be taken as temporal OVERLAP between units with duration.},

Since requirements are commonly written in natural language, they can be prone to ambiguity, incompleteness and inconsistency. Structured semantic representations allow requirements to be translated to formal models, which can be used to detect problems at an early stage of the development process through validation. Storing and querying such models can also facilitate software reuse. Several approaches constrain the input format of requirements to produce specifications, however they usually require considerable human effort in order to adopt domain-specific heuristics and/or controlled languages. We propose a mechanism that automates the mapping of requirements to formal representations using semantic role labeling. We describe the first publicly available dataset for this task, employ a hierarchical framework that allows requirements concepts to be annotated, and discuss how semantic role labeling can be adapted for parsing software requirements.},

	abstract = {Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar provides the definitive exposition of the theory of grammar originally proposed by Gerald Gazdar and developed during half a dozen years' work with his colleagues Ewan Klein, Geoffrey Pullum, and Ivan Sag. This long-awaited book contains both detailed specifications of the theory and extensive illustrations of its power to describe large parts of English grammar. Experts who wish to evaluate the theory and students learning GPSP for the first time will find this book an invaluable guide.The initial chapters lay out the theoretical machinery of GPSP in a readily intelligible way. Combining informal discussion with precise formalization, the authors describe all major aspects of their grammatical system, including a complete theory of syntactic features, phrase structure rules, meta rules, and feature instantiation principles. The book then shows just what a GPSP analysis of English syntax can accomplish. Topics include the internal structure of phrases, unbounded dependency constructions of many varieties, and coordinate conjunction--a construction long considered the sticking point for phrase structure approaches to syntax.The book concludes with a well developed proposal for a model theoretic semantic system to go along with GPSP syntax. Throughout, the authors maintain the highest standards of explicitness and rigor in developing and assessing their grammatical system. Their aim is to provide the best possible test of the hypothesis that syntactic description can be accomplished in a single-level system. And more generally, it is their intention to formulate a grammatical framework in which linguistic universals follow directly from the form of the system and therefore require no explicit statement. Their book sets new methodological standards for work in generative grammar while presenting a grammatical system of extraordinary scope.},

However, we lack case studies of how these methods can be applied in practice and what their potential impact may be. Trading Consequences is an interdisciplinary research project between environmental historians, computational linguists, and visualization specialists. It combines text mining and information visualization alongside traditional research methods in environmental history to explore commodity trade in the 19th century from a global perspective. Along with a unique data corpus, this project developed three visual interfaces to enable the exploration and analysis of four historical document collections, consisting of approximately 200,000 documents and 11 million pages related to commodity trading. In this article, we discuss the potential and limitations of our approach based on feedback from historians we elicited over the course of this project. Informing the design of such tools in the larger context of digital humanities projects, our findings show that visualization-based interfaces are a valuable starting point to large-scale explorations in historical research. Besides providing multiple visual perspectives on the document collection to highlight general patterns, it is important to provide a context in which these patterns occur and offer analytical tools for more in-depth investigations.},

We briefly review the main extant proposals, and then develop a new approach, based semantically on Aczel's notion of Frege structure, which implements a version ofsubsumption polymorphism. Nominalization is achieved by virtue of the fact that the types of predicative and propositional complements are contained in the type of individuals. Russell's paradox is avoided by placing a type-constraint on lambda-abstraction, rather than by restricting comprehension.},

Generic rules, like On weekdays, Giles normally gets up at 8.00 are then taken to induce a pre-order on possible worlds, where worlds complying with the rules are less exceptional than those which go against the rules. Thus, a particular weekday on which Giles gets up at 8.00 is less exceptional than one on which he stays in bed till noon. Unlike many other approaches to nonmonotonicity, we draw a distinction at the level of the object language between defeasible and indefeasible conclusions.},

The symposium is organised by the newly launched Network of Excellence on Language and Speech (3701) which brings together the foremost European experts and institutions in these two domains. By bringing together these two communities, which have so far been working in relative isolation from each other, the network aims to augment the focusing of research onto the long-term goal of the "construction of an integrated model of the cognitive chain linking speech to reasoning via natural language". To advance towards this industrially significant goal, the network operates at different levels - a strategy for research, a coordination for the training of needed researchers and a coordination of the use of its resource and communication infrastructure for the most efficient interworking of the members of the community who are spread all over Europe. This symposium is a small but significant building block for the achievement of the goals of the network.},

In particular it is shown how supervised machine learning was used to annotate a Twitter dataset (London Riots) with argumentation classes. An investigation of issues arising from a natural inconsistency within social media data found that machine learning algorithms tend to over fit to the data because Twitter contains a lot of repetition in the form of retweets. It is also noted that when learning argumentation classes we must be aware that the classes will most likely be of very different sizes and this must be kept in mind when analysing the results. Encouraging results were found in adapting a model from one domain of Twitter data (London Riots) to another (OR2012). When adapting a model to another dataset the most useful feature was punctuation. It is probable that the nature of punctuation in Twitter language, the very specific use in links, indicates argumentation class.},

	abstract = {The Web is one of the major repositories of human generated know-how, such as step-by-step videos and instructions. This knowledge can be potentially reused in a wide variety of applications, but it currently suffers from a lack of structure and isolation from related knowledge. To overcome these challenges we have developed a Linked Data framework which can automate the extraction of know-how from existing Web resources and generate links to related knowledge on the Linked Data Cloud. We have implemented our framework and used it to extract a Linked Data representation of two of the largest know-how repositories on the Web. We demonstrate two possible uses of the resulting dataset of real-world know-how. Firstly, we use this dataset within a Web application to offer an integrated visualization of distributed know-how resources. Lastly, we show the potential of this dataset for inferring common sense knowledge about tasks.},

	abstract = {In this paper a logical and graphical language for representing CAD knowledge in a simple design domain is presented. The language is useful for designing 2-dimensional wire-frame diagrams of the sort that are common in architectural and other kinds of drawings. The language allows the definition and interpretation of graphical symbols that are explicitly drawn on the screen, as well as the representation of other context-dependent space partitions that receive an interpretation in terms of the graphical context from which they emerge. For the identification of these emerging graphical objects we introduce the notion of intension of a graphical symbol. In addition, the language supports the definition and representation of construction lines. This facility is particularly useful for modelling causal relations between possible design states in the definition and production of design inferences.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an experimental interactive graphics interface, GRAFLOG, in which drawings receive linguistic interpretations. It is possible to emulate linguistic interaction in situations where graphics is thought to be necessary. The paper presents examples of such a kind of dialogue and the architecture of the implementation. The paper explains how representations of drawings can be constructed by treating graphical symbols as “objects”, and how a parallel linguistic interpretation for these symbols can be constructed. It highlights the relevance of “deictic expressions” and “spatial prepositions” in building the interface mechanisms between these two kinds of representations. Lastly, it shows how a reasoning component is constructed for making deductions from premises that are found in both the graphical and linguistic domains. Using GRAFLOG, it is possible to represent knowledge through words and pictures. GRAFLOG is implemented, using an object oriented programming style, in PROLOG and GKS.},
