# Stuff that didn't work

## Pandoc

http://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/primer.html
https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/issues/1619
depends on getting good CSL file, tried playing with apa-cv-mod.csl but very finnicky. Hard also to get PDF links etc working right.

## BibLaTeX

Can get nice LaTeX / PDF output, but no easy translation to reasonable HTML. PDF links again challenging. Could possibly post-process the HTML output, maybe using ht4tex. Pandoc applied to refs.tex didn't work well.

## JabRef

https://help.jabref.org/en/CommandLine

Couldn't get it to work from command line. Current layouts did downcasing of some conference proceedings
