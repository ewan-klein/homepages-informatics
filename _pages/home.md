## Research

My research career spans a range of topics, including theoretical linguistics; computational phonology, syntax and semantics; spoken dialogue with mobile robots; text mining in domains such as medical biology and digital history; the use of different forms of data in the context of Living Labs and the Internet of Things.

Before retiring, much of my work was centred on [Edinburgh Living Lab](http://edinburghlivinglab.org), where I  collaborated with colleagues in social science, design informatics, geosciences and social anthropology. A key theme was how new sources and new forms of data affect our understanding of ourselves as both individuals and as collectives.


## Side Projects

I've been involved in a number of initiatives over the last few years which go beyond standard academia. These include:

* [Prewired SCIO](https://prewired.org) is a volunteer-based coding club for under-19s. I was one of the co-founders and I am currently the chair of the Board of Trustees.

* [Smart Data Hack](http://smartdatahack.org) was a series of one-week programming and data hack events that I organised between 2013 and 2016.
