I am Professor of Language Technology in the University of Edinburgh's School of Informatics. 

My current research is centred on [Edinburgh Living Lab](Edinburgh Living Lab), where I am collaborating with colleagues in social science, design informatics, geosciences and social anthropology. A key theme is how new sources and new forms of data affect our understanding of ourselves as both individuals and as collectives. I have a strong interest in civic open data and in the 'grey area' between personal and non-personal data.
