I am Professor of Language Technology in the University of Edinburgh's [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/). 

## Research

My research career spans a range of topics, including theoretical linguistics; computational phonology, syntax and semantics; spoken dialogue with mobile robots; text mining in domains such as medical biology and digital history; the use, interpretation and social embedding of different forms of data in the context of Living Labs and the Iternet of Things.

<!-- My current research is centred on [Edinburgh Living Lab](http://edinburghlivinglab.org), where I am collaborating with colleagues in social science, design informatics, geosciences and social anthropology. A key theme is how new sources and new forms of data affect our understanding of ourselves as both individuals and as collectives. I have a strong interest in civic open data and in the 'grey area' between personal and non-personal data. -->
