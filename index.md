## Research

My research career spans a range of topics, including theoretical linguistics; computational phonology, syntax and semantics; spoken dialogue with mobile robots; text mining in domains such as medical biology and digital history; the use of different forms of data in the context of Living Labs and the Internet of Things.

Until recently my work was centred on [Edinburgh Living Lab](http://edinburghlivinglab.org), where I  collaborated with colleagues in social science, design informatics, geosciences and social anthropology. A key theme was how new sources and new forms of data affect our understanding of ourselves as both individuals and as collectives. I have a strong interest in civic open data and in the 'grey area' between personal and non-personal data.
