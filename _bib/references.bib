  abstract = {Although text mining shows considerable promise as a tool for supporting the curation of biomedical text, there is little concrete evidence as to its effectiveness. We report on three experiments measuring the extent to which curation can be speeded up with assistance from Natural Language Processing (NLP), together with subjective feedback from curators on the usability of a curation tool that integrates NLP hypotheses for protein-protein interactions (PPIs). In our curation scenario, we found that a maximum speed-up of 1/3 in curation time can be expected if NLP output is perfectly accurate. The preference of one curator for consistent NLP output and output with high recall needs to be confirmed in a larger study with several curators.},

  abstract = {Background: The tasks in BioCreative II were designed to approximate some of the laborious work involved in curating biomedical research papers. The approach to these tasks taken by the University of Edinburgh team was to adapt and extend the existing natural language processing (NLP) system that we have developed as part of a commercial curation assistant. Although this paper concentrates on using NLP to assist with curation, the system can be equally employed to extract types of information from the literature that is immediately relevant to biologists in general. Results: Our system was among the highest performing on the interaction subtasks, and competitive performance on the gene mention task was achieved with minimal development effort. For the gene normalization task, a string matching technique that can be quickly applied to new domains was shown to perform close to average. Conclusion: The technologies being developed were shown to be readily adapted to the BioCreative II tasks. Although high performance may be obtained on individual tasks such as gene mention recognition and normalization, and document classification, tasks in which a number of components must be combined, such as detection and normalization of interacting protein pairs, are still challenging for NLP systems.},

The project aimed to assist environmental historians in understanding the economic and environmental consequences of commodity trading during the 19th century. We applied TM to large quantities of historical text, converting unstructured textual information into structured data. The structured data was used to populate a relational database that is in turn the back end for querying and different types of online visualisations.

These solutions are either derived from traditional Web service standards such as WSDL or inspired by the theory of process calculus. Little attention has however been paid to finding a lightweight solution which can enable peers to obtain, publish and share service choreography in an open environment or peer-to-peer network. This paper proposes a framework for choreographing semantically enhanced Web Services encoded in a extended lightweight coordinative language which is derived from process calculus and is dedicated to running in modern Web browsers. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented and demoed as a decentralised service choreography-management platform based on this framework. There is no need for users to install any third-party application, and service choreography execution is achieved via client-side Web browsers. Also, the preliminary experiments indicate the efficiency and scalability of our proof-of-concept implementation of this framework.},

Although a growing number of methods or tools have been designed attempting at generating or digesting RDFa, comparatively little work has been carried out on finding a generic solution for publishing existing RDF data sets with the RDFa serialisation format. This paper proposes a generic and lightweight approach to generating semantically-enriched hypertext content by embedding RDF triples derived from diverse provenances in terms of a concept of topic nodes which will be automatically recommended by our discovery algorithm. RDFa2 is a proof-of-concept implementation for our approach and works as an online platform assisting Web content publishers in semi-automatically generating, personalising and curating pages with RDFa. RDFa2 has been introduced and employed by students in a master level course and the experimental results as well as additional case studies indicate the validity of this approach to generating triple-embedded Web documents such as online profiles and vocabularies with little user intervention.},

  abstract = {One of the major innovations within post-SPE generative phonology has been the development of frameworks where phonological units are organized in a non-linear fashion. Taking autosegmental phonology (Goldsmith, 1976) as our main exemplar of such frameworks, we wish to address the following question: What is the appropriate interpretation of autosegmental representations? There is, of course, a further question about what we mean by INTERPRETATION: formal, phonetic or computational interpretation? Although we will concentrate on the first of these, we believe that all three aspects should be regarded as closely inter-connected and mutually constraining. The question of interpreting autosegmental representation has in fact been recently posed by Sagey (1988), and we shall take her proposal as our starting point. While it is uncontroversial to suppose that the relationship between units on a given autosegmental tier is one of temporal precedence, Sagey claims that it is more problematic to pin down what is meant by association between tiers. She argues, cogently we believe, that if association is taken to be a relationship of simultaneity between durationless units, then standard analyses of complex segments and gemination lead to logical inconsistency. Instead, association should be taken as temporal OVERLAP between units with duration.},

The e-Science vision, and the creation of the e-Science Grid, promises the level of integrated large- scale technological support required to sustain this important and successful new technology area. In this paper, we discuss the foundations for the deployment of text mining and other language technology on the Grid \textemdash{} the protocols and tools required to build distributed large-scale language technology systems, meeting the needs of users, application builders and researchers.},

Well over 1500 participants from all over Europe are expected to attend the various events during the week. The Conference will offer the opportunity to be updated on the results of ongoing Esprit projects and to develop Europe-wide contacts with colleagues, both within a specific branch of Information Technology and across different branches. The first three days of the week are devoted to presentations of Esprit I projects, structured into plenary and parallel sessions; this year there is special emphasis on panels and workshops where participants can exchange ideas and hold in-depth discussions on specific topics. The different areas of Esprit work are covered: Microelectronics, Informa\- tion Processing Systems, Office and Business Systems, Computer Integrated Manufac\- turing, Basic Research and different aspects of the Information Exchange System. During the IT Forum on Thursday 30th November, major European industrial and political decision-makers will address the audience in the morning. In the afternoon, different aspects of Technology Transfer will be discussed with the participation of outside experts, and presentations on the future plans for community R\&D in IT will take place.},

  abstract = {Mapping functional requirements first to specifications and then to code is one of the most challenging tasks in software development. Since requirements are commonly written in natural language, they can be prone to ambiguity, incompleteness and inconsistency. Structured semantic representations allow requirements to be translated to formal models, which can be used to detect problems at an early stage of the development process through validation. Storing and querying such models can also facilitate software reuse. Several approaches constrain the input format of requirements to produce specifications, however they usually require considerable human effort in order to adopt domain-specific heuristics and/or controlled languages. We propose a mechanism that automates the mapping of requirements to formal representations using semantic role labeling. We describe the first publicly available dataset for this task, employ a hierarchical framework that allows requirements concepts to be annotated, and discuss how semantic role labeling can be adapted for parsing software requirements.},

We concern ourselves with this task: we desire to recom- mend contextually relevant citations to the author of a paper. A number of rhetorical annotation schemes for academic articles have been developed over the years, and it has often been suggested that they could find application in Information Retrieval scenarios such as this one. In this paper we investigate the usefulness for this task of CoreSC, a sentence-based, functional, scientific discourse annotation scheme (e.g. Hypothesis, Method, Result, etc.). We specifi- cally apply this to anchor text, that is, the text surrounding a citation, which is an important source of data for building document representations. By annotating each sentence in every document with CoreSC and indexing them separately by sentence class, we aim to build a more useful vector-space representation of documents in our collection. Our results show consistent links between types of citing sentences and types of cited sentences in anchor text, which we argue can indeed be exploited to increase the relevance of recommendations.},

  abstract = {Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar provides the definitive exposition of the theory of grammar originally proposed by Gerald Gazdar and developed during half a dozen years' work with his colleagues Ewan Klein, Geoffrey Pullum, and Ivan Sag. This long-awaited book contains both detailed specifications of the theory and extensive illustrations of its power to describe large parts of English grammar. Experts who wish to evaluate the theory and students learning GPSP for the first time will find this book an invaluable guide.The initial chapters lay out the theoretical machinery of GPSP in a readily intelligible way. Combining informal discussion with precise formalization, the authors describe all major aspects of their grammatical system, including a complete theory of syntactic features, phrase structure rules, meta rules, and feature instantiation principles. The book then shows just what a GPSP analysis of English syntax can accomplish. Topics include the internal structure of phrases, unbounded dependency constructions of many varieties, and coordinate conjunction--a construction long considered the sticking point for phrase structure approaches to syntax.The book concludes with a well developed proposal for a model theoretic semantic system to go along with GPSP syntax. Throughout, the authors maintain the highest standards of explicitness and rigor in developing and assessing their grammatical system. Their aim is to provide the best possible test of the hypothesis that syntactic description can be accomplished in a single-level system. And more generally, it is their intention to formulate a grammatical framework in which linguistic universals follow directly from the form of the system and therefore require no explicit statement. Their book sets new methodological standards for work in generative grammar while presenting a grammatical system of extraordinary scope.},

The human `parts' are typically considered in terms of their aggregate outcomes and collective behaviours, but human participants are rarely all equal, even within a small system. We argue that due to the complex nature of online identity, understanding participants in a more granular way is crucial for social machine observation and design. We present the results of a study of the personas portrayed by participants in a social machine that produces creative media content, and discover that inconsistent or misleading representations of individuals do not necessarily undermine the system in which they are participating. We describe a preliminary framework for making sense of human participants in social machines, and the ongoing work that develops this further.},

  abstract = {We describe the Edinburgh-Stanford approach to task 2 of the Pascal Challenge Evaluating Machine Learning for Information Extraction, the active learning task. Active learning promises to reduce the cost of supervised training by requesting the most informative data points for human annotation. The literature contains a number of approaches to selecting informative data points. Example informativity can be estimated by the degree of uncertainty of a single learner as to the correct label of a data point (Cohn et al., 1995) or in terms of the disagreement of a committee of learners (Seung et al., 1992). Active learning has been successfully applied to a variety of tasks such as document classification (McCallum and Nigam, 1998), part-of-speech tagging (Argamon-Engelson and Dagan, 1999), and parsing (Thompson et al., 1999). We employ a committee-based method where the degree of deviation of different classifiers with respect to their analysis can tell us if an example is potentially useful. Trained classifiers can be caused to be different by bagging (Abe and Mamitsuka, 1998), by randomly perturbing event counts (Argamon-Engelson and Dagan, 1999), or by employing different feature sets for the same classifiers (Baldridge and Osborne, 2004). In this paper, we present active learning experiments for information extraction following the last approach. Our approach gives the highest average improvement over random sampling for micro-averaged and macro-averaged f-scores.},

However, we lack case studies of how these methods can be applied in practice and what their potential impact may be. Trading Consequences is an interdisciplinary research project between environmental historians, computational linguists, and visualization specialists. It combines text mining and information visualization alongside traditional research methods in environmental history to explore commodity trade in the 19th century from a global perspective. Along with a unique data corpus, this project developed three visual interfaces to enable the exploration and analysis of four historical document collections, consisting of approximately 200,000 documents and 11 million pages related to commodity trading. In this article, we discuss the potential and limitations of our approach based on feedback from historians we elicited over the course of this project. Informing the design of such tools in the larger context of digital humanities projects, our findings show that visualization-based interfaces are a valuable starting point to large-scale explorations in historical research. Besides providing multiple visual perspectives on the document collection to highlight general patterns, it is important to provide a context in which these patterns occur and offer analytical tools for more in-depth investigations.},

We briefly review the main extant proposals, and then develop a new approach, based semantically on Aczel's notion of Frege structure, which implements a version ofsubsumption polymorphism. Nominalization is achieved by virtue of the fact that the types of predicative and propositional complements are contained in the type of individuals. Russell's paradox is avoided by placing a type-constraint on lambda-abstraction, rather than by restricting comprehension.},

To date, much of the focus has been on monitoring noise pollution, but the urban soundscape contains a rich variety of signals about both human and natural phenomena. We describe the CitySounds project, which has installed enclosed sensor kits at several locations across a heavily used urban greenspace in the city of Edinburgh. The acoustic monitoring components regularly capture short clips in real-time of both ultrasonic and audible noises, for example encompassing bats, birds and other wildlife, traffic, and human. The sounds are complemented by collecting other data from sensors, such as temperature and relative humidity. To ensure privacy and compliance with relevant legislation, robust methods render completely unintelligible any traces of voice or conversation that may incidentally be overheard by the sensors. We have adopted a variety of methods to encourage community engagement with the audio data and to communicate the richness of urban soundscapes to a general audience.},

Generic rules, like On weekdays, Giles normally gets up at 8.00 are then taken to induce a pre-order on possible worlds, where worlds complying with the rules are less exceptional than those which go against the rules. Thus, a particular weekday on which Giles gets up at 8.00 is less exceptional than one on which he stays in bed till noon. Unlike many other approaches to nonmonotonicity, we draw a distinction at the level of the object language between defeasible and indefeasible conclusions.},

The symposium is organised by the newly launched Network of Excellence on Language and Speech (3701) which brings together the foremost European experts and institutions in these two domains. By bringing together these two communities, which have so far been working in relative isolation from each other, the network aims to augment the focusing of research onto the long-term goal of the "construction of an integrated model of the cognitive chain linking speech to reasoning via natural language". To advance towards this industrially significant goal, the network operates at different levels - a strategy for research, a coordination for the training of needed researchers and a coordination of the use of its resource and communication infrastructure for the most efficient interworking of the members of the community who are spread all over Europe. This symposium is a small but significant building block for the achievement of the goals of the network.},

In particular it is shown how supervised machine learning was used to annotate a Twitter dataset (London Riots) with argumentation classes. An investigation of issues arising from a natural inconsistency within social media data found that machine learning algorithms tend to over fit to the data because Twitter contains a lot of repetition in the form of retweets. It is also noted that when learning argumentation classes we must be aware that the classes will most likely be of very different sizes and this must be kept in mind when analysing the results. Encouraging results were found in adapting a model from one domain of Twitter data (London Riots) to another (OR2012). When adapting a model to another dataset the most useful feature was punctuation. It is probable that the nature of punctuation in Twitter language, the very specific use in links, indicates argumentation class.},

Know-how available on the Web, such as step-by-step instructions, is largely unstructured and isolated from other sources of online knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we propose extending to procedural knowledge the benefits that Linked Data has already brought to representing, retrieving and reusing declarative knowledge. We describe a framework for representing generic know-how as Linked Data and for automatically acquiring this representation from existing resources on the Web. This system also allows the automatic generation of links between different know-how resources, and between those resources and other online knowledge bases, such as DBpedia. We discuss the results of applying this framework to a real-world scenario and we show how it outperforms existing manual community-driven integration efforts.},

This knowledge can be potentially reused in a wide variety of applications, but it currently suffers from a lack of structure and isolation from related knowledge. To overcome these challenges we have developed a Linked Data framework which can automate the extraction of know-how from existing Web resources and generate links to related knowledge on the Linked Data Cloud. We have implemented our framework and used it to extract a Linked Data representation of two of the largest know-how repositories on the Web. We demonstrate two possible uses of the resulting dataset of real-world know-how. Firstly, we use this dataset within a Web application to offer an integrated visualization of distributed know-how resources. Lastly, we show the potential of this dataset for inferring common sense knowledge about tasks.},

One of their main limitations, however, remains the general low level of data quality. In this paper we focus on a measure of quality which is negatively affected by the increase of the available resources. We propose a measure of semantic richness of Linked Data concepts and we demonstrate our hypothesis that the more a concept is reused, the less semantically rich it becomes. This is a significant scalability issue, as one of the core aspects of Linked Data is the propagation of semantic information on the Web by reusing common terms. We prove our hypothesis with respect to our measure of semantic richness and we validate our model empirically. Finally, we suggest possible future directions to address this scalability problem.},

This knowledge base is based on the prohow Linked Data vocabulary that can represent human instructions and link them to machine functionalities. Our hypothesis is that non-programmer users can describe how to achieve certain tasks at a level of abstraction which is both human and machine understandable.

It is possible to emulate linguistic interaction in situations where graphics is thought to be necessary. The paper presents examples of such a kind of dialogue and the architecture of the implementation. The paper explains how representations of drawings can be constructed by treating graphical symbols as ``objects'', and how a parallel linguistic interpretation for these symbols can be constructed. It highlights the relevance of ``deictic expressions'' and ``spatial prepositions'' in building the interface mechanisms between these two kinds of representations. Lastly, it shows how a reasoning component is constructed for making deductions from premises that are found in both the graphical and linguistic domains. Using GRAFLOG, it is possible to represent knowledge through words and pictures. GRAFLOG is implemented, using an object oriented programming style, in PROLOG and GKS.},

For the identification of these emerging graphical objects we introduce the notion of intension of a graphical symbol. In addition, the language supports the definition and representation of construction lines. This facility is particularly useful for modelling causal relations between possible design states in the definition and production of design inferences.},

  abstract = {Godot is a mobile robot platform that serves as a testbed for the interface between a sophisticated low-level robot navigation and a symbolic high-level spoken dialogue system. The interesting feature of this combined system is that information flows in two directions: (1) the navigation system. supplies landmark; information from the cognitive map used for the interpretation of the user's utterances in the dialogue system; and (2) the semantic content of utterances analysed by the dialogue system are used to adjust probabilities about the robot's position in the navigation system.},

  abstract = {We present a proposal for treating default reasoning from the perspective of a dynamic approach to semantics, where meaning is a mapping between information states. Information states are identified with sets of possible worlds\textemdash the epistemic possibilities which those states admit. Generic rules, like On weekdays, Giles normally gets up at 8.00 are then taken to induce a pre-order on possible worlds, where worlds complying with the rules are less exceptional than those which go against the rules. Thus, a particular weekday on which Giles gets up at 8.00 is less exceptional than one on which he stays in bed till noon. Unlike many other approaches to nonmonotonicity, we draw a distinction at the level of the object language between defeasible and indefeasible conclusions.},
